A calendar utility to fetch and find the owners of calendar events.

Runs in Google AppEngine

You will need to also download the closure library, closure template, closure compiler, closure css compiler and gjsling to make this work.
build.sh assumes that you have each utility in a sibling folder to your source folder, with the following structure:

>closure-library
>soy-latest
  SoyToJsSrcCompiler.jar
>compiler-latest
  compiler.jar
>css-compiler
  closure-stylesheets-20111230.jar
>[Calendar-Mailer directory]
